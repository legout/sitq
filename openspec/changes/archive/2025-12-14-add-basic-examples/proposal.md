# Add Basic Examples

## Why

The current sitq documentation contains only advanced, comprehensive examples (data-processing, web-app, microservices) that are 600-900+ lines each. While valuable, these examples can be intimidating for new users who need simple, getting-started examples to understand basic sitq concepts and patterns.

New users need:
- Simple, focused examples that demonstrate individual concepts
- Basic usage patterns without complex application logic
- Progressive learning path from basic to advanced
- Quick reference examples for common tasks

## What Changes

- Create basic examples covering fundamental sitq concepts
- Organize examples into basic and advanced categories
- Add simple, focused examples for core functionality
- Restructure documentation navigation for better learning flow

## Impact

- **New Content**: Basic examples directory with simple, focused examples
- **Reorganization**: Restructure examples navigation into basic/advanced sections
- **User Experience**: Improved learning curve for new sitq users
- **Documentation**: Better progressive documentation structure

## Scope

### Basic Examples to Add
1. **Simple Task Processing** - Basic enqueue and process
2. **Task with Arguments** - Passing data to tasks
3. **Multiple Workers** - Basic parallel processing
4. **Task Results** - Getting results back from tasks
5. **Error Handling** - Basic error handling patterns
6. **Task Status** - Monitoring task progress
7. **Batch Processing** - Processing multiple tasks
8. **Sync vs Async** - Using both APIs

### Reorganization
- Move existing examples to "Advanced" section
- Create new "Basic" examples section
- Update navigation structure
- Add cross-references between basic and advanced examples

## Dependencies

- None - this is pure documentation addition
- Builds on existing documentation system
- Complements current advanced examples
